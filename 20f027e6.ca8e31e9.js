An application process would periodically scan database tables for customers in specific states, execute necessary actions, and update the state to reflect that. While feasible, this approach has various drawbacks. The most obvious is that the state machine of the customer state quickly becomes extremely complicated. For example, charging a credit card or sending emails can fail due to a downstream system unavailability. The failed calls might need to be retried for a long time, ideally using an exponential retry policy. These calls should be throttled to not overload external systems. There should be support for poison pills to avoid blocking the whole process if a single customer record cannot be processed for whatever reason. The database-based approach also usually has performance problems. Databases are not efficient for scenarios that require constant polling for records in a specific state."),Object(n.b)("p",null,"Another commonly employed approach is to use a timer service and queues. Any update is pushed to a queue and then a worker that consumes from it updates a database and possibly pushes more messages in downstream queues.
